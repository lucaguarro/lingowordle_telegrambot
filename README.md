# WORDLE/LINGO TELEGRAM BOT
## Purpose
This is a simple telegram chatbot that allows groups of friends to play the fun game popularized by lingo and revitalized by wordle. The objective is simple. One user sets a hidden 5 letter word that the other plays subsequently try to guess. With each guess, the bot will measure how close the guess was to the actual word providing the following clues:

- 游릴 The letter exists and is in the correct position
- 游릳 The letter exists but is not in the correct position
- 游린 The letter does not exist anywhere in the word

(Note that the bot has been extended to allow words between 4-10 characters)

#### Example

Word to guess: HELLO

Guesses:
1. DRINK - 游린游린游린游린游린
2. LEAST - 游릳游릴游린游린游린
3. HELLS - 游릴游릴游릴游릴游린
